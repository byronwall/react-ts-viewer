# TODO

- Get things to run quickly on 1 file
- Save the index results to disk
- Need to show the deps going into hooks and the variables being used
- Show the props coming into a comp - trace those through the parents + tree
- Keep trucking on the plan - get Cursor to update the status and README with current functionality
- Publish to npm + VS Code Marketplace
