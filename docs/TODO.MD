# TODO

- Get things to run quickly on 1 file - OK
- Save the index results to disk
- Need to show the deps going into hooks and the variables being used
  - Need to get hooks to appear in single file view
- Show the props coming into a comp - trace those through the parents + tree
- Keep trucking on the plan - get Cursor to update the status and README with current functionality
- Publish to npm + VS Code Marketplace

Improve single file display:

- Group by file (do not show as a separate node)
- Still need to see external deps - show them as a box with each import listed?
- Show repeated hooks with a count instead of a list
- Allow a click to expand the node to show deps for a given hook

Biggest annoyances:

- Graph view is awful
- Need to hide minimap by default
- Need to show internal + external deps
- Show the total child count in the structure view
- Structure view needs to go in the left panel under the input + settings; settings should be a popover instead of always visible
-
